## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**

    If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine.  Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd web-task
    ```

3.  **Open with Live Server (Recommended):**

    If you have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code, this is the easiest way to run the project.

    *   Open the project folder in VS Code.
    *   Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    *   The project will launch in your default web browser.

4.  **Alternative: Start Live Server Manually:**

    If you have Live Server installed globally on your system, you can start it from the terminal:

    ```bash
    npx live-server
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    live-server
    ```

    This will open the project in your default browser, and any changes you make to the code will be reflected instantly.
